  <div id="explanation">
    <p>“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.” – Steve Jobs</p>
    <p>This is a compilation of ideas we could find that had been generated in the last year. It includes brainstorms in the Circle of Experts exercises, mobile reach, mobile summit, and others.</p>
    <p>We know that we've missed a tonne, so feel free to add stickies! If you see an idea that you've had or you're super excited by, add your initials under it!</p>
